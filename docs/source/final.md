# Final
As discussed, SKATE is still undergoing significant development, and is not yet a
complete digitization package. Future work will address the most important needs including, but
not limited to: better meanline identification, improved rejection of spurious features, and the
incorporation of advanced segment connection algorithms. Bug reports and comments on
SKATE should be directed to <a href="mailto:andy@retrievertech.com.">Dr. Andrew Bartlett</a>.
