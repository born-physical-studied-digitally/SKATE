In Santa Fe, there is a very strong community of researchers, software developers and
business professionals that we were fortunate to be able to tap into. Our partnership with the
Redfish Group was invaluable in developing many of the technologies used in SKATE. Stephen
Guerin led the effort, with important input from Frank Wimberly, Owen Densmore, and others.

The core of the website and the underlying algorithms were created by an amazingly
talented group of developers. Marius Nita and Ben Lichtner developed the impressive user
interface and its underlying code; if you like this website and what it does, thank them. Benamy
Yashar took a wide range of image processing tools and molded them into a processing pipeline
that is impressive in so many ways. And our summer intern, Lowell Bartlett, did an superb job
creating segment connection algorithms and automatic feature detection code.
